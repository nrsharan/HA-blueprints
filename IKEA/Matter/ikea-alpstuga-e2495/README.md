# 🌬️ IKEA ALPSTUGA E2495 Air Quality Sensor (Matter)

Pro-grade automation for the **IKEA ALPSTUGA E2495** Matter Air Quality sensor. This blueprint allows you to trigger specific actions when any environmental metric—CO2, PM2.5, Air Quality Index, Temperature, or Humidity—crosses your custom thresholds.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Air Quality** entity is a general "Air Quality Index" (AQI) calculated by the device (usually based on PM2.5 and CO2 levels). While the ALPSTUGA does not have a dedicated VOC sensor, this summary state is a great way to trigger whole-room air clear actions.

## 🌟 Key Features

*   **Five Environmental Triggers**: Dedicated actions for CO2, PM2.5, Air Quality summary, Temperature, and Humidity.
*   **Flexible Thresholds**: Set numeric cutoffs for sensors, or select specific states (e.g., "Poor") for the General Air Quality summary.
*   **Stabilization Time**: Prevent notification "flapping" by requiring states to remain active for a configurable duration (e.g., 30 seconds).
*   **Parallel Execution**: Handles multiple environmental shifts concurrently (e.g., boosting the air purifier while notifying about high CO2).

## 💡 Example Use Cases

*   **🍃 Air Purification**: 
    *   **Air Quality High**: Automatically boost your air purifier to "High" when the general air quality index drops.
    *   **PM2.5 High**: Trigger targeted actions for dust or smoke levels above 25 µg/m³.
*   **🛏️ Healthy Sleep & Focus**:
    *   **CO2 High**: Receive an alert or flash a light in your office or bedroom when CO2 levels exceed 1000 ppm, signaling it's time to open a window.
*   **🛁 Ventilation & Recuperation**:
    *   **High Humidity**: Automatically trigger the bathroom fan or a whole-home recuperation system when humidity levels spike.
*   **🏢 HVAC Control**: 
    *   **High Temp**: Turn on cooling when the room hits 26°C (79°F).
    *   **Low Temp**: Activate heating when it drops below 18°C (64°F).

### 💡 Pro Tip: Dynamic Notifications
You can make your alerts smarter by including the actual sensor value or state in your message. When setting up a notification action, use the following template in your message text:

*   **For CO2/PM2.5**: `CO2 level is now {{ trigger.to_state.state }} ppm`
*   **For Air Quality**: `Air quality status is now {{ trigger.to_state.state }}`

### 🛡️ Preventing "Notification Storms"
If you are receiving too many notifications in a short time, it's usually caused by the sensor "flapping" between states. To fix this:

1.  **Adjust Trigger States**: In the Air Quality settings, ensure you **unselect "Good" and "Fair"**. This prevents getting an alert every time the air *improves* back to normal.
2.  **Use Stabilization Time**: Increase the **Stabilization Time** (e.g., to 30 or 60 seconds). The blueprint will then wait for the sensor to stay at the new state for that duration before alerting you.
