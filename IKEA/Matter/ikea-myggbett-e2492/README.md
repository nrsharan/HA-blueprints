## 🚀 Benefits

*   **Multi-Stage Logic**: Trigger immediate actions (e.g., turn on light) followed by delayed actions (e.g., notify if door is left open too long).
*   **Parallel Execution**: Handles multiple state changes and timers concurrently.
*   **Battery Management**: Built-in battery low monitoring with a configurable threshold (default 30%).
*   **Highly Flexible**: All actions are optional and support multiple sub-actions.

## 💡 Example Use Cases

*   **Bathroom Occupancy**: 
    *   **Open**: Turn on light.
    *   **Closed Long**: After 30 minutes of being closed, ensure lights are off as a backup.
*   **Garage Door Security**:
    *   **Open Immediate**: Turn on garage light.
    *   **Open Long**: After 15 minutes, notify "Garage door left open!" or automatically close it.
*   **🔋 Maintenance**: 
    *   **Battery Low**: Receive a notification when the battery level drops below 30%, giving you plenty of time to recharge or swap.

## 🛠️ Requirements

*   **IKEA MYGGBETT (E2492)** sensor connected via **Matter**.
*   The sensor should expose a `binary_sensor` with `device_class: door`, `window`, or `opening`.
*   (Optional) The sensor should expose a `sensor` with `device_class: battery`.
