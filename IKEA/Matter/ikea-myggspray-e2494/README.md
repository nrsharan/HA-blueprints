## 🌟 Key Features

*   **Flexible Action Selection**: Choose any Home Assistant action for both "Motion Detected" and "Motion Stopped".
*   **Illuminance Cutoff**: Only trigger the "Motion Detected" action if the light level is below your chosen LUX threshold.
*   **Sunlight-Aware Actions**: Dedicated "High" and "Low" light thresholds to trigger actions when it gets too bright or too dark (e.g., closing/opening curtains).
*   **Integrated Battery Alerts**: Configurable low-battery monitoring (default 10%).
*   **Parallel Mode**: Handles motion timers, light alerts, and battery checks concurrently.

## 💡 Example Use Cases

*   **🌙 Security & Comfort Lighting**: 
    *   **Motion Detected**: Turn on the porch light, but only if the illuminance is below 10 LUX (nighttime).
    *   **Motion Stopped**: Turn off the light after 2 minutes of inactivity.
*   **☀️ Smart Blinds & Curtains**: 
    *   **High Light**: Automatically close the smart blinds when the room gets too bright (e.g., above 5000 LUX) to prevent glare and overheating.
    *   **Low Light**: Open the blinds when the sun sets and the light level drops below your comfort threshold.
*   **🔋 Maintenance**: 
    *   **Battery Low**: Receive a notification when the battery level drops below 30%, giving you plenty of time to recharge or swap.

## 🛠️ Requirements

*   **IKEA MYGGSPRAY (E2494)** sensor connected via **Matter**.
*   The sensor should expose a `binary_sensor` with `device_class: motion` or `occupancy`.
*   (Optional) The sensor should expose sensors for `illuminance` and `battery`.
