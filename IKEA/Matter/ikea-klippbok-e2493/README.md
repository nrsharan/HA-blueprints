# 💧 IKEA KLIPPBOK E2493 Leak Sensor (Matter)

Full-featured automation for the **IKEA KLIPPBOK E2493** Matter leak sensor. This blueprint provides a highly flexible way to respond to leak detections, with support for immediate alerts, delayed secondary actions (if still wet), all-clear notifications, and integrated battery monitoring.

## 🌟 Key Features

*   **Dual-Stage Wet Actions**: Trigger something immediately (like a siren) and something else if it stays wet for a while (like a push notification).
*   **Dual-Stage Dry Actions**: Trigger actions as soon as it's dry, and optionally wait to confirm it stays dry.
*   **Integrated Battery Monitoring**: No need for separate battery automations. Get notified directly when the battery drops below your chosen threshold.
*   **Parallel Execution**: Uses Home Assistant's `parallel` mode to ensure multiple events (leak + low battery) are handled concurrently without missing a beat.
*   **Professional Logic**: Includes safety checks to ensure delayed actions only run if the sensor is still in the expected state.

## 💡 Example Use Cases

*   **🚨 Critical Alerts**: 
    *   **Wet Immediate**: Trigger a siren and flash red lights as soon as a leak is detected under the washing machine.
    *   **Wet Long**: If the sensor stays wet for 5 minutes, send a high-priority notification to all family members.
*   **🔌 Automatic Shutdown**: 
    *   **Wet Immediate**: Use a smart plug to instantly turn off the power to a dishwasher or water heater when moisture is sensed.
*   **✅ All Clear**: 
    *   **Dry Long**: Once the area has been dried, wait for 10 minutes to confirm it's truly clear before resetting your smart home's "Water Leak" status.
*   **🔋 Maintenance**: 
    *   **Battery Low**: Receive a notification when the battery level drops below 30%, giving you plenty of time to recharge or swap.

## 🛠️ Requirements

*   **IKEA KLIPPBOK (E2493)** sensor connected via **Matter**.
*   The sensor should expose a `binary_sensor` with `device_class: moisture`.
*   (Optional) The sensor should expose a `sensor` with `device_class: battery`.
